# PostgreSQL
The PostgreSQL object-relational database system provides reliability and data integrity.

Futher details about the Postgres image can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/).

## Overview

Using this docker-compose.yml file you can start up the latest Postgres database server and configure it with a few simple edits.

## Setup

Open the docker-compose.yml file and change the key/value pairs under the environment section.  The values are pretty straight forward.

    POSTGRES_DB       - Name of the database to autocreate
    POSTGRES_USER     - Username used to connect to the database
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD - Password used to connect to the database

## Usage

Change to the directory of the docker-compose.yml file and run the following docker-compose command.

    docker-compose up -d

Docker will start to download the Postgres image from DockerHub if you donâ€™t already have it.  When the download is complete the container will start and configure the database according to the settings from above.
